To Do:
	BUG FIX:
		Combat
			Npc attack box doesn't set to trigger (never ends)
			
	Health/Mana 
		Visuals for health/mana (player)
		
	Inventory
		Inventory will be set by me and can only be manipulated that way. Player can choose to wield whatever items but I decide the pack
	
	Placement Puzzles
		Place items in holes (Inventory check)
		
	Karma
		Karma system will save throughout the game with options changing depending on what you do (different NPCs are hostile, give different items)
		Create variables on NPCs to respond to different karma (or not being there at all)
		
	Round Two:
		Improved AI
			Teleporting
		Killable land terrain
		Health restoring/depleting land terrain
		Ability to receive and give items to NPCs
		Follower NPCs?
		Objects slide on ice
		Reavers: modified humans and animals that listen to Vox and his subordinates
			When a Reaver attack hits it places the user under the Reaver Effect
				While under the effect, player health cannot regenerate and, when the player experiences death, it causes a perma...death
					Permadeath results in meeting with the Eternal (who respawns the player) but comes at a penalty
		Quest log

Future:
	During polishing, with the directions have them have a bit of nuance but not 100% correct
		Replace the int casting for a little bit of range (like a float?)
	During polishing, wander should not stray too far from the start point when it begins to move
		Should also be a bit less random
	Cutscene errors when skipping too fast
	The Ot Brothers (Little, Middle, Big (Bigot)), Mark robots (Named due to Mark I, Mark II, etc), Breaking fourth wall with text talk
	Awesome puzzle with sliding and teleports
		Means that objects also have to be able to slide around on ice
	Observation Puzzles: Need to observe the room/level/game for the answer
	Cutscene animation testing more
	Magic that drains health instead of mana

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	4/4

	3/30
		-Animation (access to)
		-Movement: facing certain directions
			-Working for Player
				-Check if its less than or greater for the horz/vert scale and change current direction by that
	
	3/29
		-Located reason npc isn't moving is because when it processes decisions it overrides
			-Have plan to deal with it
		-Movement in cutscenes is working for NPCs
	
	3/28

	3/24
		-Finished dialogue responding correctly (Update instead of FixedUpdate)
		-Created KeyboardInputs to keep track of used buttons and whether they are active or not
	
	3/23
		-Started work on keyboard watcher to detect key inputs/outputs better
		-UI: Visuals for dialogue
	
	3/22
		-Have options for the player
		-Player has choices in dialogue
		-Dialogue has ability to loop

	3/14
		-Started dialogue system
	
	3/13
		-Moveable objects (pick up and drop)

		-Buttons and Button Controller to respond to moveable/slideable objects
		-Dialogue Controller/Dialogues have been started and can have a minor conversation
	
	3/12
		-Combine teleporter into terrain piece
		-Got rid of jump pads (too similar to use as teleports)
		-Able to climb by facing forward
	
	3/11
		-Removed PixelCrushers items for my own
	
	3/10
		-Directional teleportation
		-Separate collision interpreter from player movement
		-Fixed: teleporter not working right after being used and sliding
			-Caused: Only checking if terrain is not null
			-Fixed by allowing a teleporter to be a valid option
		-Security for project
			-Private repo ($7 a month)
			-2 Step Verification
			-Access token
		
	3/9
		-Learned that sliding continues indefinitely so no need to fix
		-Created CharacterAnimator class
		-Collision with hard block causes a stop until being moved again
	
	3/8
		-Interaction box and attack box are now under interactions

	3/7
		-Fixed issue with colliding downwards into a friction block in determineIfCurrentlyColliding by add isFrictionStopNeeded section
		-Created easier to use collision detector so it can be expanded upon
		-Fixed Bug: If you somewhat touch ice and then walk away, the current terrain is stored as ice and it can be used later

	3/6
		-Have collision when going up start with the bottom collider (looks like stepping on ice)
		-Fixed: Apply friction stop once player has fully entered the area
			-Caused: Bounds of the player were not entering/exiting
			-Fixed by checking for the bounds of the player and the collider
		-Fixed: Player starts north, then looks left before going right
			-Caused: Player to look right before going another direction
			-Fixed by changing the animator since it was not like all of the others

	3/5
		-Fixed: Attack collider causing interactions to fire when they shouldn'target
			-Caused by adding and never subtracting since it never 'exits' and just disappears

		-Sliding blocks that don't stop until a friction spot is hit
		-Teleport pads (sibling pads)
		-Fixed bugs
			Ice is not stopping
		
	3/3
		-Created terrain script
		-Slowdown is working
		-Sliding is working

		-Fixed direction issue on player (animator had wrong values)

	3/2
		-Finished Lever Puzzle(Activate buttons in order)
		-Finished Lever Puzzle(On/Off Puzzle)
	3/1
		-Set up for lever puzzles
		-Created defaults
	2/29
		-Enemies shouldn't have their movements changed unless they are the cause of it

		-Replace wander with a more up to date version (not having it segmented around)
	2/28
		-When enemies are near for an attack, make sure they are looking at the player even if their last position says otherwise
		-Probably should have target point for movement be a passed in variable instead of relying on the change to be made manually

		-Get rid of dash standalone
		-Standardize left, right, up, and down for currentDirection variable (Left:0 - Up:1 - Right:2 - Down:3)
	2/27
		-Attack delay
		-End attack when opponent is hit
		-Weapon database
		-Have it so if character/weapon doesn't exist then it tells the user
		-Set currentDirection for NPC to be determined by movement (so if they are moving of their own accord the currentDirection reflects the correct way)
			allow controller to see so it can pass it on to the combat area
		-Weapon range + width (in database and implemented)
