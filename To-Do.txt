To Do:		
	Placement Puzzles
		Place items in holes (Inventory check)
		Slide certain pieces on to certain tiles (basic check between type of platform and type of moving/sliding piece)
		
	Karma
		Karma system will save throughout the game with options changing depending on what you do (different NPCs are hostile, give different items)
		Create variables on NPCs to respond to different karma (or not being there at all)
	
	Comment
		If it has to be put on a GameObject on screen (DB) or is on a Prefab, make note
		
	Round Two:
		Improved AI
			Teleporting
			Pouncing
		Killable land terrain
		Health restoring/depleting land terrain
		Ability to receive and give items to NPCs
		Follower NPCs?
		Objects slide on ice
		Reavers: modified humans and animals that listen to Vox and his subordinates
			When a Reaver attack hits it places the user under the Reaver Effect
				While under the effect, player health cannot regenerate and, when the player experiences death, it causes a perma...death
					Permadeath results in meeting with the Eternal (who respawns the player) but comes at a penalty
		Quest log
		UI: growing as the player gains more health
		UI: clean it up and tighten
		Inventory: Make sure things work when selected (hit boxes change, speed delays, etc (will be heavily with other classes)

Future:
	Inventory will be set by me and can only be manipulated that way. Player can choose to wield whatever items but I decide the pack
	During polishing, with the directions have them have a bit of nuance but not 100% correct
		Replace the int casting for a little bit of range (like a float?)
	During polishing, wander should not stray too far from the start point when it begins to move
		Should also be a bit less random
	Cutscene errors when skipping too fast
	The Ot Brothers (Little, Middle, Big (Bigot)), Mark robots (Named due to Mark I, Mark II, etc), Breaking fourth wall with text talk
	Awesome puzzle with sliding and teleports
		Means that objects also have to be able to slide around on ice
	Observation Puzzles: Need to observe the room/level/game for the answer
	Cutscene animation testing more
	Magic that drains health instead of mana (blood magic)

	4/10

			-Gives a description when clicked

			-Double clicking equips/uses the item and deselects the others of the same class
			-Have it modify the player with database information (Pipeline is set up, works with combat)

		-Movement: facing certain directions
			-Working for Player

	3/29
		-Located reason npc isn't moving is because when it processes decisions it overrides
