To Do:
	Enemies shouldn't have their movements changed unless they are the cause of it
		applied to player as well, shouldn't have pushing
			maybe try applying a reverse force?
				might have to rethink calculateCurrentDirection in the case of a collision
	When enemies are below and going for a side attack, maybe they should be at the feet of the enemy?
		-issue getting stuck on people

Future:
	During polishing, with the directions have them have a bit of nuance but not 100% correct
		Replace the int casting for a little bit of range
		
Done:
	2/29
		
	2/28
		-When enemies are near for an attack, make sure they are looking at the player even if their last position says otherwise
		-Probably should have target point for movement be a passed in variable instead of relying on the change to be made manually
		-Repair dash
		-Get rid of dash standalone
		-Standardize left, right, up, and down for currentDirection variable (Left:0 - Up:1 - Right:2 - Down:3)
	2/27
		-Attack delay
		-End attack when opponent is hit
		-Weapon database
		-Have it so if character/weapon doesn't exist then it tells the user
		-Set currentDirection for NPC to be determined by movement (so if they are moving of their own accord the currentDirection reflects the correct way)
			allow controller to see so it can pass it on to the combat area
		-Weapon range + width (in database and implemented)
		
		
		Down = Good
		Left = new Vector2(0, -attackRange);
		Up = new Vector2(0, attackRange);
		Right = new Vector2(0, attackRange);
