To Do:		
	Phase Two:		
		Quest log
			Quests need to be individually called up from Questline
				After a quest is complete:
					For every quest that is complete as a result, expire
					Adds any active quest that relied on that one previously
					Quests that are given are added to the UI
			Kill Quests need to be able to spawn characters if quest is active
			
		UI
			Growing as the player gains more health
			Clean it up and tighten (FOR EVERYTHING)
				Includes staying on when things resize
			NPC health bars disappearing (switch to newest Unity the cause?)
			
		Autosave
			Issue with the newest Unity update
				Might not be an issue anymore?
		
		Sound pipeline
			Puzzles: make indication when something is wrong/right (noise)
			
		Animation pipeline
		
		Cutscene 
			Errors when skipping too fast (text gets chopped up)
			Animation testing
	
		Player	
			Player Experience: Lead to more health and mana?
			PlayerMaster: beAwareOfChildColliders - make it so, when not used, colliders a re put inside the parent so this won't be needed
			PlayerMovement: separate sliding things into a new class			
			Have character chat change upon karma levels
				Change karma level for certain answers
			Multiple Protagonists
			Magic
				Magic attacks
				Magic that drains health instead of mana (blood magic)
				
		NPCs
			Improved AI
				Teleporting
				Pouncing
			Ability to receive and give items to NPCs
			Follower NPCs
			Reavers: modified humans and animals that listen to Vox and his subordinates
				When a Reaver attack hits it places the user under the Reaver Effect
					While under the effect, player health cannot regenerate and, when the player experiences death, it causes a perma...death
						Permadeath results in meeting with the Eternal (who respawns the player) but comes at a penalty
			Shape Changers: change their looks and attack styles
			Shopkeepers
			NPC respond when hit
			Wander should not stray too far from the start point when it begins to move
				Should also be a bit less random
			The directions have them have a bit of nuance but not 100% correct
			Replace the int casting for a little bit of range (like a float?)
				
		Refactor code
		
		Bugs?
			Talking not working on first key press
			Quest updating after completion
			Health isnt showing above enemies
		
	Phase Three:
		Start piecing things together
			Create levels
			Create NPCs that are specialized
			Create puzzles in levels
			Specialized Karma reactions
			
		The Ot Brothers (Little, Middle, Big (Bigot))
		
		Mark robots (Named due to Mark I, Mark II, etc)
		
		The Hero's ('Save' a town from monsters they unleash on it (Musical Inspiration: Avatar - The Eagle Has Landed)
		
		Bedlam (woman who used to be quiet but snapped)
		
		Breaking fourth wall with text talk
		
		Observation Puzzles: Need to observe the room/level/game for the answer
		
	Phase Four:
		Level Design
			Puzzles 
				Sliding and teleports
					- can add friction stop to button too	
					
		Animation
			Player enters water and changes sprite. When they leave they return. No inbetween (like a pool ladder or the like)
				Unless feeling masochistic, in which case animate a few sections of it (one whole body then quarter it off by water levels)
