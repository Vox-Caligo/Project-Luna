To Do:
	Enemies shouldn't have their movements changed unless they are the cause of it
	When enemies are below and going for a side attack, maybe they should be at the feet of the enemy?
		-issue getting stuck on people
	Probably should have target point for movement be a passed in variable instead of relying on the change to be made manually
	Standardize left, right, up, and down for currentDirection variable
		Left:	0
		Up:		1
		Right: 	2
		Down:	3

Done:
	2/28
		-When enemies are near for an attack, make sure they are looking at the player even if their last position says otherwise
	2/27
		-Attack delay
		-End attack when opponent is hit
		-Weapon database
		-Have it so if character/weapon doesn't exist then it tells the user
		-Set currentDirection for NPC to be determined by movement (so if they are moving of their own accord the currentDirection reflects the correct way)
			allow controller to see so it can pass it on to the combat area
		-Weapon range + width (in database and implemented)
		
		Left:	0
		Right: 	1
		Up:		2
		Down:	3
