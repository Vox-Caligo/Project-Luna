To Do:
	Terrain
		Teleport pads (sibling pads)
			Awesome puzzle with sliding and teleports
	Jump Pad Puzzles
		Puzzle where you hit jump pads and have to navigate the course (somewhat maze like)
	Placement Puzzles
		Place things in the correct spot
		2 types
			-Place items in holes
			-Place items down and they move to a location
	Observation
		Need to observe the room/level/game for the answer

Future:
	During polishing, with the directions have them have a bit of nuance but not 100% correct
		Replace the int casting for a little bit of range
	During polishing, wander should not stray too far from the start point when it begins to move
		
Done:
	3/3
		-Created terrain script
		-Slowdown is working
		-Sliding is working
		-Fixed so colliders are applied until the object is completely out
		-Fixed direction issue on player (animator had wrong values)

	3/2
		-Finished Lever Puzzle(Activate buttons in order)
		-Finished Lever Puzzle(On/Off Puzzle)
	3/1
		-Set up for lever puzzles
		-Created defaults
	2/29
		-Enemies shouldn't have their movements changed unless they are the cause of it
		-When enemies are below and going for a side attack, maybe they should be at the feet of the enemy?
		-Replace wander with a more up to date version (not having it segmented around)
	2/28
		-When enemies are near for an attack, make sure they are looking at the player even if their last position says otherwise
		-Probably should have target point for movement be a passed in variable instead of relying on the change to be made manually
		-Repair dash
		-Get rid of dash standalone
		-Standardize left, right, up, and down for currentDirection variable (Left:0 - Up:1 - Right:2 - Down:3)
	2/27
		-Attack delay
		-End attack when opponent is hit
		-Weapon database
		-Have it so if character/weapon doesn't exist then it tells the user
		-Set currentDirection for NPC to be determined by movement (so if they are moving of their own accord the currentDirection reflects the correct way)
			allow controller to see so it can pass it on to the combat area
		-Weapon range + width (in database and implemented)
		
		
		Down = Good
		Left = new Vector2(0, -attackRange);
		Up = new Vector2(0, attackRange);
		Right = new Vector2(0, attackRange);
