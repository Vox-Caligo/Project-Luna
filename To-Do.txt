To Do:
	Fix bug
		Player starts north, then looks left before going right
		Apply friction stop once player has fully entered the area (think it has to do with all boxes entering/exiting again like it was for ice originally)
			-Check the current points thing and see if it just keeps going up and down or the like
			-May also be because, the the box being in front it stops as soon as both hit
				-like how ice only works when both touch, even for a split second
	Jump Pad Puzzles
		Puzzle where you hit jump pads and have to navigate the course (somewhat maze like)
	Placement Puzzles
		Place things in the correct spot
		2 types
			-Place items in holes
			-Place items down and they move to a location
	Observation
		Need to observe the room/level/game for the answer
	UI
		Visuals for health
		Text boxes

Future:
	During polishing, with the directions have them have a bit of nuance but not 100% correct
		Replace the int casting for a little bit of range
	During polishing, wander should not stray too far from the start point when it begins to move
	Awesome puzzle with sliding and teleports
		
Done:
	3/5
		-Fixed: Attack collider causing interactions to fire when they shouldn'target
			-Caused by adding and never subtracting since it never 'exits' and just disappears
			-Fixed by having attack always be around, just a trigger instead of an attack
		-Issue where the attack can be used as the interaction box

	3/4
		-Sliding blocks that don't stop until a friction spot is hit
		-Teleport pads (sibling pads)
		-Fixed bugs
			Ice is not stopping
		
	3/3
		-Created terrain script
		-Slowdown is working
		-Sliding is working
		-Fixed so colliders are applied until the object is completely out
		-Fixed direction issue on player (animator had wrong values)

	3/2
		-Finished Lever Puzzle(Activate buttons in order)
		-Finished Lever Puzzle(On/Off Puzzle)
	3/1
		-Set up for lever puzzles
		-Created defaults
	2/29
		-Enemies shouldn't have their movements changed unless they are the cause of it
		-When enemies are below and going for a side attack, maybe they should be at the feet of the enemy?
		-Replace wander with a more up to date version (not having it segmented around)
	2/28
		-When enemies are near for an attack, make sure they are looking at the player even if their last position says otherwise
		-Probably should have target point for movement be a passed in variable instead of relying on the change to be made manually
		-Repair dash
		-Get rid of dash standalone
		-Standardize left, right, up, and down for currentDirection variable (Left:0 - Up:1 - Right:2 - Down:3)
	2/27
		-Attack delay
		-End attack when opponent is hit
		-Weapon database
		-Have it so if character/weapon doesn't exist then it tells the user
		-Set currentDirection for NPC to be determined by movement (so if they are moving of their own accord the currentDirection reflects the correct way)
			allow controller to see so it can pass it on to the combat area
		-Weapon range + width (in database and implemented)
