To Do:
	Placement Puzzles
		Place items in holes (Inventory check)	
	UI
		Visuals for health
		Visuals for dialogue
	Inventory
		Inventory will be set by me and can only be manipulated that way. Player can choose to wield whatever items but I decide the pack
	Dialogue System
		Better detection for engaging in conversation
	Cutscenes
	Karma
		Karma system will save throughout the game with options changing depending on what you do (different NPCs are hostile, give different items)
	Health/Mana 
		Auto regenerate

Future:
	During polishing, with the directions have them have a bit of nuance but not 100% correct
		Replace the int casting for a little bit of range
	During polishing, wander should not stray too far from the start point when it begins to move
	May move keyboard inputs into master
	The Ot Brothers (Little, Middle, Big (Bigot)), Mark robots (Named due to Mark I, Mark II, etc), Breaking fourth wall with text talk
	Awesome puzzle with sliding and teleports
	Observation Puzzles: Need to observe the room/level/game for the answer

	3/23
		-Started work on keyboard watcher to detect key inputs/outputs better
	
	3/22
		-Have options for the player
		-Player has choices in dialogue
		-Dialogue has ability to loop
		-Cleaned up dialogue creation so it can be declared in half the lines
	
	3/21
		-Have images for those talking
		-Store the section to repeat/continue from in the talking class
	
	3/15
		-Dialogue system places text out on piece at a time
		-Ability to skip through a conversation
		
	3/14
		-Started dialogue system
	
	3/13
		-Moveable objects (pick up and drop)
		-Slideable objects (slides when pushed)
		-Buttons and Button Controller to respond to moveable/slideable objects
		-Dialogue Controller/Dialogues have been started and can have a minor conversation
	
	3/12
		-Combine teleporter into terrain piece
		-Got rid of jump pads (too similar to use as teleports)
		-Able to climb by facing forward
	
	3/11
		-Removed PixelCrushers items for my own
	
	3/10
		-Directional teleportation
		-Separate collision interpreter from player movement
		-Fixed: teleporter not working right after being used and sliding
			-Caused: Only checking if terrain is not null
			-Fixed by allowing a teleporter to be a valid option
		-Security for project
			-Private repo ($7 a month)
			-2 Step Verification
			-Access token
		
	3/9
		-Learned that sliding continues indefinitely so no need to fix
		-Created CharacterAnimator class
		-Collision with hard block causes a stop until being moved again
	
	3/8
		-Interaction box and attack box are now under interactions

	3/7
		-Fixed issue with colliding downwards into a friction block in determineIfCurrentlyColliding by add isFrictionStopNeeded section
		-Created easier to use collision detector so it can be expanded upon
		-Fixed Bug: If you somewhat touch ice and then walk away, the current terrain is stored as ice and it can be used later

	3/6
		-Have collision when going up start with the bottom collider (looks like stepping on ice)
		-Fixed: Apply friction stop once player has fully entered the area
			-Caused: Bounds of the player were not entering/exiting
			-Fixed by checking for the bounds of the player and the collider
		-Fixed: Player starts north, then looks left before going right
			-Caused: Player to look right before going another direction
			-Fixed by changing the animator since it was not like all of the others

	3/5
		-Fixed: Attack collider causing interactions to fire when they shouldn'target
			-Caused by adding and never subtracting since it never 'exits' and just disappears
			-Fixed by having attack always be around, just a trigger instead of an attack
		-Issue where the attack can be used as the interaction box

	3/4
		-Sliding blocks that don't stop until a friction spot is hit
		-Teleport pads (sibling pads)
		-Fixed bugs
			Ice is not stopping
		
	3/3
		-Created terrain script
		-Slowdown is working
		-Sliding is working
		-Fixed so colliders are applied until the object is completely out
		-Fixed direction issue on player (animator had wrong values)

	3/2
		-Finished Lever Puzzle(Activate buttons in order)
		-Finished Lever Puzzle(On/Off Puzzle)
	3/1
		-Set up for lever puzzles
		-Created defaults
	2/29
		-Enemies shouldn't have their movements changed unless they are the cause of it
		-When enemies are below and going for a side attack, maybe they should be at the feet of the enemy?
		-Replace wander with a more up to date version (not having it segmented around)
	2/28
		-When enemies are near for an attack, make sure they are looking at the player even if their last position says otherwise
		-Probably should have target point for movement be a passed in variable instead of relying on the change to be made manually
		-Repair dash
		-Get rid of dash standalone
		-Standardize left, right, up, and down for currentDirection variable (Left:0 - Up:1 - Right:2 - Down:3)
	2/27
		-Attack delay
		-End attack when opponent is hit
		-Weapon database
		-Have it so if character/weapon doesn't exist then it tells the user
		-Set currentDirection for NPC to be determined by movement (so if they are moving of their own accord the currentDirection reflects the correct way)
			allow controller to see so it can pass it on to the combat area
		-Weapon range + width (in database and implemented)
